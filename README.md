# CM30225-Parallel-Computing
Coursework for third year university course.

These projects were done from November 2018 to January 2019 for the Parallel computing course.
Both projects involved carrying out relaxation of an array of numbers by iteratively averaging the values of each array fields nearest neighbours. This was done using shared memory through the use of POSIX pthreads and using distributed memory with MPI.
